Warren Buffett is one of the world’s most successful investors and freely shares his views on how to make money in the stock market. Buffett is the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and one of the world’s richest people, with a new wealth of nearly $100 billion. Affectionately known as the “Oracle of Omaha”, he has been the largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway since 1970. He has consistently outperformed the market because of his ability to identify quality companies and buy them at a fair price. Over the years, he has shared many investment philosophies and guidelines — many of which are based on Benjamin Graham’s value investing principles. A tongue-in-cheek, but very valuable principle, is: “Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1.” Others include “If the business does well, the stock eventually follows” and “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price”. Here are seven prominent rules from Warren Buffett for making money in the stock market. Buffett shares many other rules, like “never invest on borrowed money”, but these seven rules are a good start to understanding his investment philosophy.
