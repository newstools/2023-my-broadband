Huawei has revealed launch details and pricing for its latest flagship smartphone — the Mate 50 Pro —in South Africa. The Huawei Mate 50 Pro was first released in the company’s other major global markets in September 2022. The premium smartphone features a symmetrical body design with a prominent aluminium alloy camera ring on the back. The edge of the ring boasts pyramid-shaped Clous de Paris embossing, often used in luxurious wristwatches, jewellery, and other accessories. Inside the ring, users will find a powerful rear triple shooter consisting of a 50MP primary sensor, a 13MP ultra-wide lens, and a 64MP periscope telephoto camera. Dubbed the “Huawei Ultra Aperture Camera”, it features a 10-size adjustable physical aperture, allowing for substantial improvements in image processing and quality. This has produced perhaps its most noteworthy achievement among critics — topping the DxOMark’s smartphone camera rankings with an overall score of 149. With that rating, it beat strong smartphone cameras like the Google Pixel 7 Pro and Apple iPhone 14 Pro. DxOMark found the Mate 50 Pro could shoot high-quality photos and videos indoors and outdoors, with “truly outstanding” performance in low light. The innovative variable aperture system also helped to take great group portraits and low-light images, while another highlight was the impressive up to 200x zoom capabilities.  The large 6.74-inch OLED display on the Mate 50 Pro offers a 2,616 x 1,212 resolution with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. For added protection from damage due to falls or impacts, Huawei has integrated its newly-developed Kunlun Glass to boost durability. The material consists of 10 quadrillion-level nanocrystals, created using composite ion strengthening, 24-hour nanocrystal growth at high temperatures, 108-step micro-crystalline matrix material and panel processing techniques, and 1,600℃ platinum smelting technology. This results in a 10x increase in drop resistance, making the Mate 50 the first smartphone to ever achieve five-star glass drop resistance certification from Switzerland’s SGS. When it comes to internal hardware, the first important update is that Huawei has moved away from its in-house Kirin chips, due to struggles with the development as a result of the US trade ban. Instead, the company has opted for Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor. In all models, it comes paired with 8GB of RAM.  Unfortunately, the version of the chip shopping in the Mate 50 Pro lacks 5G connectivity, which has become a standard on most new flagships from its rivals. That should not be a total deal-breaker for those users who are satisfied with their 4G network speeds in South Africa. In terms of everyday use, the Mate 50 Pro packs a massive 4,700mAh battery that can be quickly refilled using 66W wired charging or 50W wireless charging. For reverse charging wearables or other phones, it also gets 5W wireless reverse charging.
