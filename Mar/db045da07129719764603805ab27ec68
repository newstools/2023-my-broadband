Eskom plans to continue implementing load-shedding at stage 4 until further notice instead of ramping up to stage 5 on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning. In a short statement at noon on Wednesday, the utility said the lower-than-planned load-shedding was possible due to the return to service of three coal power station units. A unit each at the Kriel, Majuba, and Matimba power stations were returned to the grid. For reference, each of Kriel’s six units has a maximum capacity of 500MW, while Matimba’s six units were designed to generate 665MW each. Majuba has three units with a maximum capacity of 665MW each and three that can deliver up to 716MW. In theory, that means a maximum of 1,881MW of capacity was returned to service, equal to roughly two stages of load-shedding. However, with the state of Eskom’s generating fleet, most of these units are likely unable to reach anywhere near their maximum outputs. Eskom had originally planned to implement stage 5 load-shedding from 16:00 on Wednesday until 05:00 on Thursday. The utility did not provide further details on the amount of capacity it had available at the time of its statement. It requested South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly.
