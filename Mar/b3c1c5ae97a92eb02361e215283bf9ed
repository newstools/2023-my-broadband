There are two ways to promote your business on the show: Executive interview packages give your expert (or experts) their own episode on What’s Next. They can use this episode to talk about anything they want – from information about your latest products and services to fascinating thought leadership. These interviews are then published on the What’s Next website, MyBroadband, YouTube, Facebook, and Spotify. Season sponsorships are also very popular, as they put your company’s branding on an entire season of the show.
