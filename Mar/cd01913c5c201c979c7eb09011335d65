Ripple Labs, the company associated with the popular XRP cryptocurrency, has some of its funds in Silicon Valley Bank, chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse said in a tweet Sunday. The company expects “no disruption in our day-to-day business,” and already held a majority of its cash in a network of banks, Garlinghouse said. “Obviously a lot is still unknown about what happens with SVB, and as is the case with many others, we hope to have more details soon – but rest assured, Ripple remains in a strong financial position,” Garlinghouse said. It’s ironic that so much of what’s happening (as some companies scramble to make payroll) highlights how broken our financial systems still are – i.e. wires are still not 24/7/365, rumors lead to collapse and the frictions of moving money within a deeply fragmented system. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) March 12, 2023 A Ripple representative declined to share how much money Ripple holds at the bank. XRP is the world’s sixth-biggest cryptocurrency, with a market value of nearly $19 billion, according to CoinGecko data.
