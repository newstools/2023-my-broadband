Cell C has announced the appointment of Stephen Morony as chief officer for its wholesale business. Morony officially started in the role on 1 January 2023. “He returns to Cell C, having been responsible for the end-to-end management of Cell C’s mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) as the executive head for six years,” the company said in a statement. Morony has over twenty years of experience in the ICT sector and holds a BCom in Informatics from UNISA and an MBA from the Wits Graduate School of Business. In his new role, he will focus on building Cell C’s wholesale business division — a critical growth pillar for the operator. He will also lead the creation of a robust wholesale digital solutions platform and be responsible for entrenching Cell C’s positioning as a leader and preferred provider for MVNOs. Another key focus will be securing new business opportunities in the SME and public sector space. “I am pleased to welcome Stephen back to the Cell C family and wish him much success as he executes on a strategy that is geared at leveraging the potential of the wholesale business division,” said Cell C CEO Douglas Craigie Stevenson.
