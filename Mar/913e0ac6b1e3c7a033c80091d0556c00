Showmax brings some great Originals to the table in March: true crime documentary Stella and no-holds-barred series Sex & Pleasure, and Ghanian series The Billionaire’s Wife. Fans of international series are spoilt for choice, too: critically acclaimed series like The English, and new seasons of Succession, The Flight Attendant and The Good Fight.  Taking place in Johannesburg, Adulting follows four varsity friends. Their strong bond has held them together even as their journeys in life have taken them in very different directions. Theirs is the bromance of the decade. Thembinkosi Mthembu (Mabutho in The River and King Dingiswayo in the upcoming Shaka iLembe) stars as successful businessman Bonga, with Luthando BU Mthembu (Big Brother Mzansi) as toy boy Vuyani, Thabiso Rammutsi (The Suit) as cheating family man Mpho, and Nhanhla Kunene (Muvhango) as hot-headed bad-boy Eric. Also look out for the likes of SAFTA nominee Winnie Ntshaba (The Herd) and Sikelelwa Vuyeleni (Hope) as Vuyani’s sugar mamma and Eric’s baby mamma respectively; Lungile Duma (The River) as Mpho’s wife; and Buhle Samuels (One Night KwaMxolisi) and newcomer Londeka Shishi as Bonga’s love interests. Adulting is created by Tshedza Pictures’ Phatu Makwarela and Gwydion Beynon, who’ve won five Best Scriptwriting SAFTAs in the past four years for smash hit shows like The Republic and The River, which was also nominated for an International Emmy. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Stella Murders investigates the deaths of best friends Sharnelle Hough (17) and Marna Engelbrecht (16) at their hostel at Stella High School in North West. On Saturday morning, 26 May 2018, Sharnelle was found hanged by the staircase and Marna was discovered in a bathroom, with both deaths initially looking like suicides. The 90-minute documentary features interviews with Ronnie and Sonja Hough, Sharnelle’s parents; Stefaans, Rianet, and Riané Engelbrecht, Marna’s father, mother and sister; Captain Zagaries Human, the Stella South African Police Services station commander; Captain Markus Ferreira, the investigating officer; private investigator Chris Saunders; and Advocate Johan Smit, the state prosecutor, now retired. Also look out for Marizka Coetzer from Devilsdorp, who covered the Stella Murders case for Huisgenoot. Home to just over 4 000 people, Stella is a small, quiet cattle-farming dorpie near Vryburg in North West. “In such a close-knit community, danger is expected to come from the outside,” says clinical psychologist Elmarie Claassens in the trailer. “But the thing about danger is: it doesn’t come exclusively from the outside.” Stella Murders is a new true crime documentary from David Enright and IdeaCandy, the director and production company respectively behind the breakout hit Devilsdorp, one of Showmax’s ten most streamed titles of 2021, which sold internationally and won the 2022 SAFTA for Best Made for TV Documentary. “Everyone has sex,” says Coconut Kelz at the start of the trailer for the new Showmax Original Sex & Pleasure. “Even your most conservative grandmother had eight kids. So let’s talk about it.” Sex in Afrikaans was one of the 10 most streamed titles on Showmax in South Africa in 2022, but it’s clearly not just Afrikaners who like to knyp die kat in the donker. Hosted by writer Kim Windvogel and journalist Romantha Botha, Sex & Pleasure will take a broader view of what South Africans get up to behind closed doors, and, well, everywhere else too. Each episode will explore tlof tlof in relation to a different topic: sex work, parenting, love, drugs, orgasm, disability, age, and spirituality. Kim and Romantha co-wrote and conceptualised Sex & Pleasure with director Ayanda Duma, who was also a producer on the South African leg of Planet Sex with Cara Delevigne, which you can binge on Showmax now. SAFTA winner IdeaCandy (Steinheist, Devilsdorp) is producing the eight-part series, which includes playful motion graphics by Mbali Hlatshwayo.

Created by Oscar nominee Jesse Armstrong (Veep), Succession is the 69th highest-rated show of all time on IMDb, with Season 3 at 97% in the critics’ ratings on Rotten Tomatoes.  Wanna … PRAY? Chucky is coming for the clergy in Season 2 of the hit TV series, based on the killer doll’s three-decades-long cult film franchise.

Season 6 has a 94% critics’ rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with Entertainment Weekly saying, “Good Fight is officially the weirdest normal show ever,” and praising its ability to “dramatise genuine chaos better than almost any TV show of our chaotic era.” <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> HBO Max’s smash hit The Flight Attendant returns for a second season with Cassie (Kaley Cuoco from The Big Bang Theory) braving sobriety as she tries to clean up the hot mess she’s made of her life… while moonlighting as a CIA asset.

Season 2 has an 85% critics’ rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with Financial Times saying, “Cuoco’s Cassie remains a magnetic heroine forever on the precipice of calamity.”  It’s time to remake history with the revival of the cult-classic series Quantum Leap which ran from 1989-1993. It’s been almost 30 years since Dr Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) stepped into the Quantum Leap accelerator and vanished. Now, a new team, led by physicist Ben Song (Raymond Lee), has been assembled to restart the project and try to unlock the mysteries behind the machine and the man who created it. But everything changes when Ben makes an unauthorised leap into the past… Quantum Leap has already been renewed for a second season. Boasting a rare 100% critics’ rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Season 2 of The Capture once again questions if we can really believe what we see. Britain is under siege: hacked news feeds, manipulated media, and interference in politics. Entrenched in the UK’s own ‘Correction’ unit, DCI Rachel Carey (Holliday Grainger) finds herself in the middle of a new conspiracy – with a new target. But how can she solve this case when she can’t even trust her closest colleagues? Escalating from the CCTV thriller of Season 1, the six-part season features “invisible” assassins, the terrifying rise of deepfake technology, the ever-growing tension between government and Big Tech, and corruption at the heart of the British media.  Leopard Skin kicks off with a criminal gang taking shelter in the remote paradise of Playa Perdida, Mexico, following a botched jewellery heist. They take Alba, Batty and their guests hostage.
