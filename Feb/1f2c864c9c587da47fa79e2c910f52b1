Former Eskom CEO André de Ruyter said the next Eskom CEO needs to be a “good, solid, honest patriot” with the necessary business and operational skills, in an interview with Talk 702 earlier this month – before he left Eskom with immediate effect. The next CEO will also need to have “political nous” to cut through what De Ruyter calls the “Gwede knot” and the generally incoherent nature of reporting to multiple ministries. The political environment the next CEO will operate in requires being able to handle an “elevated level of complexity” as Eskom by itself is a complex business. This complexity is compounded by incoherent government policies and the diffusion of responsibility across numerous ministries. Most important among the abilities of the new CEO is the ability to operate in a “particularly challenging environment when it comes to crime and corruption”. Crime and corruption are endemic within Eskom and the “ecosystem in which we operate”, according to de Ruyter. De Ruyter would still have taken the job in 2019 knowing what he knows now, he said at the time. Below is a comparison between what was the ideal candidate to be Eskom’s CEO in 2019 and what is required in 2023, based on Eskom’s advertisements for the position. The most notable addition in 2023 is the requirement to “comply with Government policies”, which has led to fears that the Eskom board is looking for a pliant CEO, not necessarily the best for the job. Another additional requirement is that the candidate has “unquestionable integrity and ethics”, which implies that previously Eskom has not had such people as CEO.
