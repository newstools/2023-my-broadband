Hybrid and electric vehicle sales in South Africa have risen significantly during 2022, with traditional battery hybrid (BHEV) sales increasing by approximately 320% during the year. Combined traditional hybrid sales in the first three quarters of 2022 was 2,638 — a marked increase over the 627 sold in 2021. This is according to National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) data included in its third quarter business review. Naamsa classifies plug-in hybrids, traditional hybrids, and electric cars as new energy vehicles (NEVs), for which South African sales grew by almost 250% in 2022. Overall, 896 NEVs were sold in South Africa in 2021 and 3,092 in 2022. The breakdown of NEVs sold in South Africa this year is as follows: To illustrate the growth of NEV sales in South Africa over the past five years, Naamsa provided sales stats from 2017 through to the third quarter of 2022. Traditional hybrids have performed well compared with plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles over the years, outselling plug-in hybrids every year except in 2018. However, plug-in hybrids use newer technologies, while the range of electric car models available in South Africa was extremely limited until recently. The adoption of traditional hybrids in South Africa appears to have accelerated since 2020. From 2017 to 2020, BHEV sales averaged only 143 units a year. As mentioned previously, this increased to 627 BHEVs in 2021. Sales accelerated further in the first quarter of 2022 to 1,257 units. Although sales dropped off slightly in the second and third quarters of the year, BHEV sales remain relatively high compared to prior years. The cheapest BHEV available in South Africa is Toyota’s Corolla Cross 1.8XS Hybrid, for which prices start at R425,400. It generates 72kW of power, with a top speed of 170km/h and a consumption figure of 4.3l/100km. However, it should be noted that all consumption figures listed in the article are those provided by the manufacturer and are based on a combined cycle.
