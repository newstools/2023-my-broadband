Daily Investor is South Africa’s premier investment news and analysis platform and has achieved impressive growth since it was launched by Broad Media in August 2022. The publication has rapidly built an audience of 350,000 South African fund managers, analysts, finance professionals, and retail investors. Over 30,000 readers have created user profiles on the site, and more than 31,000 readers have signed up for the publication’s daily email newsletter. This incredible growth is thanks to Daily Investor’s excellent content.

It offers a fresh perspective on large, medium, and small-cap companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), as well as extensive coverage of international stocks – particularly US equities – and macroeconomic events.
