Eskom has reduced load-shedding from stage 5 to stage 4 from 05:00 on Friday. The state-owned power utility said it would maintain this level of load-shedding until further notice. “A full statement will be issued as soon as there [are] any further developments,” Eskom said. Earlier in the week, Eskom increased load-shedding to stage 5 after four generating unit breakdowns at different power stations. The return-to-service of some generating units had also been delayed. Eskom planned to switch to an alternating stage 4/stage 5 schedule from Saturday. The table below summarises Eskom’s current load-shedding outlook based on its recent statement.
