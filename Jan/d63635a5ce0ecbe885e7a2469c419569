Over the last 14 years, Eskom’s financial and operational performance plummeted, and it is now selling less electricity than it did in 2008. Eskom has a proud history. For 85 years, the power utility provided South Africa with reliable, affordable electricity. Eskom created a world-class generation and distribution network which supplied more than half of the electricity in Africa in 1990. It was also highly efficient. Eskom said in its 1994 annual report that it was the world’s lowest-cost producer of electricity. Eskom even won the prestigious Power Company of the Year Award at the Global Energy Awards ceremony held in New York in December 2001. South Africans loved the company, and in 2004, Eskom was named South Africa’s most admired brand in the Markinor/Sunday Times Top Brands Survey. Fast forward two decades, and Eskom is unrecognisable. It is the most hated company in South Africa and cannot provide enough electricity to keep the lights on. Eskom’s failure is causing tremendous damage to South Africa’s economy, and the power utility is riddled with corruption, mismanagement, and inefficiencies. Its collapse is causing tremendous damage to the economy and contributes to unemployment, poverty, and money leaving the country.
