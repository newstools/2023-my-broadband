A slew of new electric vehicles (EVs) is set to roll out in South Africa in 2023. Last year saw the highest number of new electric car models launched to the local market yet. Overall, 13 new EVs debuted in South Africa, with new models on offer from three German automotive heavyweights — Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. According to data from the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa, the year also saw sales of new EV cars surge. 350 fully-electric models were sold by the end of September 2022, compared to 218 in the entire 2021 and 154 in 2019. 2020 was an anomaly due to lockdowns significantly reducing vehicle sales. At the time of publication, at least nine more EV models were confirmed or likely to make their way to South African showrooms in 2023. This year’s offering includes a Chinese car praised for its excellent range and extensive features at an affordable price in other markets — GWM’s Ora Cat. The Porsche/Beetle-looking hatchback is expected to retail in South Africa for around R600,000, based on its UK pricing, which would make it the most affordable fully-electric model in the country. At the other end of the spectrum is the ultra-luxurious Rolls Royce Spectre, the carmaker’s first-ever fully-electric car. Alongside GWM and Rolls Royce, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Toyota, and Volvo are also set to bring some EVs to South African roads. Below is a list of expected and confirmed EVs for launch in South Africa in 2023. In instances where more than one variant of a car might be available, we’ve included the specifications of the entry-level and top-end versions.
