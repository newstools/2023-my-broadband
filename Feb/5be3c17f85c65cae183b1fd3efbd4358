If you’re a professional in South Africa, you probably have work buddies – people who make your days that little bit brighter. However, people come and go – your work buddy may find a new job or move departments. In contrast, Epson EcoTank printers are the ultimate work buddies because they are reliable and won’t leave you hanging. Right now, shop the full range on Takealot – all at great prices. Here are five more reasons Epson EcoTank printers are the best work buddies you could ask for. Nothing is worse than wasting time on a false friend – so rather invest your time and energy on an EcoTank printer that has a faster single-page output than any competing printer brand on the market. For example, the L14150 EcoTank has a 250-sheet paper tray and print speeds of 17 pages per minute. It also boasts double-sided printing and a 35-page automatic document feeder – so you’ll be able to speed through a variety of printing jobs with ease. Colleagues may forget to pay you back for last week’s lunch, whereas EcoTank printers will actually save you up to 90% in printing costs. A single set of EcoTank inks will give you as many vibrant and full-colour prints as 79 cartridges in traditional inkjet printers. One mono ink bottle prints 14,000 pages – the equivalent of five laser printer toner cartridges. Maintaining good relationships is difficult – but your EcoTank printer needs minimal care and maintenance to keep running smoothly. There are two main reasons for this – the innovative EcoTank ink filling system, and the Epson Smart Panel App – which keeps track of what’s happening with your printer. The Smart Panel App also lets you print remotely and is the ultimate troubleshooting tool, too. We all know that a work friend who can help you solve your IT problems is worth their weight in gold. Well, Epson EcoTank printers will help you avoid these problems altogether thanks to several intelligent technologies – including a mess-free ink filling system with a key lock design; and Micro Piezo PrecisionCore Print Head technology. The Epson EcoTank L15150 has all of these features and many more – including A3+ print, scan, copy, and a low cost per page. A friend who’s green is a friend indeed – and Epson’s EcoTank printers use heat-free technology that helps you achieve your environmental goals. This technology requires less power to operate – reducing your carbon footprint while also saving you money on electricity bills. These printers are also designed with fewer parts so that less plastic ends up in landfills when they are disposed. It is clear that Epson EcoTank printers are your ultimate work colleague – so shop the entire EcoTank range on Takealot. Click here to find out more about Epson EcoTank printers.
