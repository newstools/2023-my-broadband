Update — 19:50: The website appears to be back online. Twitter users trying to access the service from its website are being greeted with an error message. “Your current API plan does not include access to this endpoint,” it states. Twitter’s smartphone applications still appear to be working, including posting tweets. Links that use Twitter’s default URL shortener do not work. The website outage comes amid a crackdown on its application programming interface (API), cutting off third-party Twitter clients. Various Twitter “bot” and plugin developers were also to be affected by the change, although they are still working for now. These include services that automatically post articles from news websites, blogs, and other social media platforms to Twitter.  According to Downdetector, the problem began around 19:00. Twitter has been experiencing more frequent outages following mass lay-offs after Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform. Most recently, people’s feeds were left blank, and users were presented with either an error message or a message that said, “Welcome to Twitter!” In 2022, Musk eliminated over 3,700 jobs at Twitter. At the end of February, at least 50 more people were reportedly let go. Among those in the latest wave of retrenchments were Leah Culver, who worked on Twitter’s iOS app, and Twitter Payments chief executive Esther Crawford.
