Samsung has brought back its R10,000 trade-in programme for the Galaxy Z Fold4 and Flip4, allowing customers to save a fair portion of the cost provided the device they want to trade in is up to standard. The company has listed devices that, if fully functional, will give its customers a guaranteed R10,000 discount on their next purchase. However, they can still get a good deal if they trade in a device not included in the list. Furthermore, the company is offering trade-in deals on the Galaxy S22 lineup. Those who wish to trade in -eligible devices must meet the following criteria to be guaranteed the discount: Samsung’s trade-in questionnaire also gives the option for customers to include a working power adapter and cable. However, this has no benefit for devices eligible for the R10,000 discount, so it is advisable to hold on to your adapter and charger. The devices you can trade in for a guaranteed R10,000 saving on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold4 — assuming they meet the above requirements — are listed in the table below.

These devices include various older iPhones, Samsung’s Galaxy A series, and several less-prominent manufacturers like Xiaomi and Honor. It should be noted, however, that there are several iPhone models — including the iPhone SE (2020) and iPhone 8 — that still qualify for the R10,000 trade-in value despite not being included in Samsung’s qualifying devices list.
