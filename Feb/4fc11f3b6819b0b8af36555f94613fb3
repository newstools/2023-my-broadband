Eskom has revealed the load-shedding stages it plans to implement for the rest of the week. Speaking at a media briefing on Monday afternoon, Eskom CEO André de Ruyter explained why it was necessary to implement stage 6 load-shedding in the “prevailing generation situation”. De Ruyter said the utility had around 12,318MW offline due to full load losses and another 5,993MW in partial load losses. Furthermore, coal constraints and a boiler tube leak at Lethabo Power Station resulted in another 2,100MW being unavailable. Lastly, Eskom was performing planned maintenance on about 3,766MW of capacity. Taken together, these outages amounted to 24,177MW. That would result in Eskom having a shortfall of around 5,834MW in generation capacity when considering the anticipated demand of 27,282MW for the Monday evening peak. De Ruyter said that Eskom expected to return about 3,000MW of generation on Monday, followed by 2,000MW on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. However, because Eskom had to continue running its open-cycle gas turbines “hard” to meet demand, De Ruyter said it had to continue implementing load-shedding at high levels. Should things go according to plan, De Ruyter said Eskom would implement load-shedding as follows in the coming week: De Ruyter also listed some of the significant contributors to the generation shortfall: The CEO said the balance of Eskom’s coal-fired fleet was old and unreliable, which meant that incidents like the coal shortage at Lethabo created a severe capacity shortfall that required urgent action.
